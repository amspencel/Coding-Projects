# Coding-Projects
All my individual/cool school projects that aren't against honor code and I can make public
Branch 1. Song of the day Project
  - Coded in python
  - An personal project where I had a program that would choose a random song from a text file which held my Spotify playlist. 
  - It would then print the chosen song link in which I'd post the song of the day for 100 days on my Instagram.
Branch 2. Python Art Project
  - Used Pillow Imaging Library to recreate an artwork.
  - Uses a multitude of techniques and linear coordinates to reproduce artwork
