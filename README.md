All my individual/cool school projects that aren't against honor code and I can make public

 \
**Branch 1. Song of the day Project**



* Coded in Python
* A personal project where I had a program that would choose a random song from a text file which held my Spotify playlist.
* It would then print the chosen song link in which I'd post the song of the day for 100 days on my Instagram.

**Branch 2. Python Art Project**



* Individual/school project. More of an individual project that was optional classwork. Coded in Python.
* Used Pillow Imaging Library to recreate an artwork.
* Uses a multitude of techniques and linear coordinates to reproduce artwork

**Branch 3. ISA Converter**



* Coded in Java - IntelliJ. Individual project.
* Created a program that takes in plain expressions such as “register1 += register3” and translates it into binary/hex instruction to be used in the ToyISA (a mock up ISA used in the Computers System and Organization (CSO) class at UVA)
* ToyISA was used in multiple CSO homeworks

**Branch 4. Discord Bot**



* Coded in Python - PyCharm - Discord API
* Individual project
* Implemented a bot that would respond with a message, quote, gif, or reaction to user messages that contained proper command prefix 
* Used in two different personal Discord servers, one of which has frequent user traffic (my friends). However the bot was hosted locally as free online bot hosting is no longer an option.

**Others where code cannot be shared:**

**AWS Scanning:**



* Internship related project - Python Script - AWS Clou
* Developed a Python script to retrieve S3 keys for machine learning purposes from AWS DynamoDB. 
* The script intelligently navigates through different workflows based on given inputs, ensuring efficient retrieval of the required data. 
* Implemented logic to handle various scenarios and streamline the workflow process for improved efficiency and accuracy

**Command-Line UI Course Review Application:**



* Class related group project - Java - IntelliJ - JDBC, SQLite, Three-layered architecture
* Created a course-review system with a command line UI that allowed students to login in, write and see course reviews for UVA courses.
* Worked with two other group members, was mainly responsible for the presentation layer (command line UI) and some of the business logic related to the main menu

**Built Multiple Websites:**



* _Internship related - WordPress and CMS with CSS, some Javascript, and HTML_
* _Will update when those have been cleared and published_
